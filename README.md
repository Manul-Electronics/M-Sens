# M-Sens
M-Sens is a family of Open Source and Open Hardware sensors.

For now on this family includes the following devices : 
- [ ] **(Work in progress)** Tropic : A headless relative humidity and temperature sensor build around the HTU31D from TE Connectivity 
- [ ] **(Work in progress)** Mother : A Raspberry Pi based gateway with support for a variaty of communication protocols (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee, ...) built to act as home automation server and central point.

*Other devices could join the family in the future but as I work alone it could be in a very long time.*
